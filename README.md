# Review-Based Rating Prediction
---

## Overview
In a world where users constantly review products and services, both individuals and companies rely on various parameters to assess the quality of their offerings. One of the most commonly used evaluation methods is the star rating system ⭐. These stars serve as a key indicator of whether a product or service meets customer expectations.

However, even customers sometimes struggle to accurately assess how well a product met their needs, leading to inconsistencies in ratings—for example, assigning five stars when the experience was great or just one star when it was terrible.

This project aims to study classification algorithms applied to user reviews. Additionally, in an exploratory and engaging way, it seeks to develop a system capable of predicting and suggesting appropriate star ratings based on the textual content of a user’s review.

For the development of this project, the following technologies were used:

Programming Language: Python
